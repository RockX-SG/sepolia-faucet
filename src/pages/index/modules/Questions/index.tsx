              This faucet is running on the RockX Sepolia network. To prevent
              malicious actors from exhausting all available funds or
              accumulating enough Ether to mount long running spam attacks,
              requests are tied to common 3rd party social network accounts.
              Anyone having a Twitter account may request funds within the
              permitted limits.

          <FoldableBox title="What is the Sepolia testnet?">
            <div>
              Sepolia is a proof-of-work (PoW) testnet where developers can test
              their dApps. Sepolia differs from other Ethereum testnets in that
              most of its PoW validators are public. As Sepolia is a testnet,
              this also presents the possibility that some validators may stop
              validating, resulting in the chain failing to finalize. This makes
              Sepolia one of the best testnets for examining how decentralized
              systems perform under adverse circumstances.
